## ðŸ§  ZombieDaddy AI â€“ Powered by Google Gemini

### ðŸ”§ Setup

Before running the application, make sure to install the required package:
```bash
pip install -U -q 'google-genai'

```


### ðŸ¤– AI Model Integration

This project utilizes the following Google Gemini model:

```text
Model: gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25
```
This program connects to the Google Gemini API using an API key to access the "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25" model. The model functions similarly to GPT, generating human-like responses. Its main purpose is to analyze the userâ€™s previous health data â€” including macronutrients, height, weight, age, and more â€” and generate a personalized summary along with a recommendation plan.



# GenerateContentConfig settings
We customized the ZombieDaddy AI by modifying the GenerateContentConfig, specifically adjusting the SafetySetting to detect harmful or dangerous content at the lowest threshold. Additionally, we updated the system_instruction to define the AIâ€™s identity as a professional fitness coach.
```bash
safety_settings = {
    "harm_category": "harmful_and_dangerous_content",
    "threshold": "BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"
}
system_instruction = "You are a professional fitness coach helping users improve their health through safe and personalized recommendations."
```
These configurations ensure that all responses and fitness plans generated by ZombieDaddy are safe and appropriate for users.
